    (You're just too good to be true
    Can't take my eyes off of you
    You'd be like Heaven to touch
    I wanna hold you so much
    At long last, love has arrived
    And I thank God I'm alive
    You're just too good to be true
    Can't take my eyes off of you
    Pardon the way that I stare
    There's nothin' else to compare
    The sight of you leaves me weak
    There are no words left to speak
    But if you feel like I feel
    Please let me know that it's real
    You're just too good to be true
    Can't take my eyes off of you
    I love you, baby
    And if it's quite alright
    I need you, baby
    To warm the lonely night
    I love you, baby
    Trust in me when I say
    Oh, pretty baby
    Don't bring me down, I pray
    Oh, pretty baby
    Now that I've found you, stay
